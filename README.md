This is a practice repository. It contains some files that run my AWS RDS to S3 Data Ingestion pipeline. Some files are missing due to security reasons.

The first step is to run the run-this-first-venv-setup.bat file. It will automatically download the Python version used in this project and install the required libraries and its tested versions as well.
--> This script will first check if you already have the right python versions installed at your local disk C. It will then check if you have a virtual environment folder. Even if you have both, I HIGHLY SUGGEST to uninstall the required Python version and deleting any virtual environment folder in order to fresh install them.
--> You can uninstall any undesired Python version from your PC easily with Windows uninstall tool. If you have problems during the uninstallation, you can right-click Python, select "modify" and repair it before proceding to normal uninstallation.
